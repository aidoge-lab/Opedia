# Conv2d


Conv2d¶


class torch.nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1, bias=True, padding_mode='zeros', device=None, dtype=None)[source]¶
Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
planes.
In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
(N,Cin,H,W)(N, C_{\text{in}}, H, W)(N,Cin​,H,W) and output (N,Cout,Hout,Wout)(N, C_{\text{out}}, H_{\text{out}}, W_{\text{out}})(N,Cout​,Hout​,Wout​)
can be precisely described as:

out(Ni,Coutj)=bias(Coutj)+∑k=0Cin−1weight(Coutj,k)⋆input(Ni,k)\text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
\sum_{k = 0}^{C_{\text{in}} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k) \star \text{input}(N_i, k)

out(Ni​,Coutj​​)=bias(Coutj​​)+k=0∑Cin​−1​weight(Coutj​​,k)⋆input(Ni​,k)where ⋆\star⋆ is the valid 2D cross-correlation operator,
NNN is a batch size, CCC denotes a number of channels,
HHH is a height of input planes in pixels, and WWW is
width in pixels.
This module supports TensorFloat32.
On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use different precision for backward.

stride controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
number or a tuple.
padding controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It
can be either a string {‘valid’, ‘same’} or an int / a tuple of ints giving the
amount of implicit padding applied on both sides.
dilation controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
known as the à trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this link
has a nice visualization of what dilation does.
groups controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
in_channels and out_channels must both be divisible by
groups. For example,


At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels
and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
concatenated.
At groups= in_channels, each input channel is convolved with
its own set of filters (of size
out_channelsin_channels\frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{in\_channels}}in_channelsout_channels​).




The parameters kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation can either be:


a single int – in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
a tuple of two ints – in which case, the first int is used for the height dimension,
and the second int for the width dimension



Note
When groups == in_channels and out_channels == K * in_channels,
where K is a positive integer, this operation is also known as a “depthwise convolution”.
In other words, for an input of size (N,Cin,Lin)(N, C_{in}, L_{in})(N,Cin​,Lin​),
a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier K can be performed with the arguments
(Cin=Cin,Cout=Cin×K,...,groups=Cin)(C_\text{in}=C_\text{in}, C_\text{out}=C_\text{in} \times \text{K}, ..., \text{groups}=C_\text{in})(Cin​=Cin​,Cout​=Cin​×K,...,groups=Cin​).


Note
In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True. See Reproducibility for more information.


Note
padding='valid' is the same as no padding. padding='same' pads
the input so the output has the shape as the input. However, this mode
doesn’t support any stride values other than 1.


Note
This module supports complex data types i.e. complex32, complex64, complex128.

Variables

weight (Tensor) – the learnable weights of the module of shape
(out_channels,in_channelsgroups,(\text{out\_channels}, \frac{\text{in\_channels}}{\text{groups}},(out_channels,groupsin_channels​,
kernel_size[0],kernel_size[1])\text{kernel\_size[0]}, \text{kernel\_size[1]})kernel_size[0],kernel_size[1]).
The values of these weights are sampled from
U(−k,k)\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})U(−k​,k​) where
k=groupsCin∗∏i=01kernel_size[i]k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{in} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}k=Cin​∗∏i=01​kernel_size[i]groups​
bias (Tensor) – the learnable bias of the module of shape
(out_channels). If bias is True,
then the values of these weights are
sampled from U(−k,k)\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})U(−k​,k​) where
k=groupsCin∗∏i=01kernel_size[i]k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{in} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}k=Cin​∗∏i=01​kernel_size[i]groups​
